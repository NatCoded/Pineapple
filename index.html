    <h3>Let me Flesh this out</h3>
    <div class="bodytxt">
<p>What's the big hype with pineapple? Listen, its an amazing fruit. One of my absolute favorites. I love it so 
    dearly and I love how many things it pairs with. Listen this shouldn't be controversial, it is delicious on pizza and it always will be. 
    Although my favorite pizza may be controversial. Pineapple, onion, feta, jalapeño. Those are the best toppings. Green pepper also good, 
    and sun dried tomato, black olives, pepperoni. Pineapple is also cool because it will digest you back. It contains an enzyme, bromelain, 
    which breaks down proteins. It's a food that fights back, badass! More thank anything, it is fighting back against boring food as it pairs 
    with an exceptional amount of other flavors. Something I hope you will come to appreciate as you peruse this blog.

<div class="bodytxt">
<p>Let's address the big one right away. Pineapple on pizza. For some reason this is a controversial topic. Peronally I think even 
    arguing about it is boring and played out. If you don't like it, fine. That's your prerogative. People have different tastes and that 
    is okay. But personally pineapple adds the most wonderful sweet tangy to help compliment the marinara and offset the cheese. Perhaps a 
    controversial opinion but I actually think that Hawaiian is one of the least interesting ways to eat pizza. Yes ham and pineapple go 
    together wonderfully (we'll get to that later) but as far as complimenting your pizza go that is just the tip of the iceberg. Pineapple 
    and pepperoni are a far more interesting combination in my mind with the spiciness of the pepperoni bringing a strong balancing flavor 
    to the mix. On a similar note, jalapeño also work well.
</p>
<p>The delictable pineapple really brings something to pizza that I think few other toppings can. The next closest thing that I can think of 
    would be the tomato, something that no one disputes as belonging on a pizza. Both vibrant acidic fruits that bring a slight sweet edge that 
    perfects a savory classic.

    <div class="bodytxt">
        <p>Aren't these the same thing? Well yes, but we need to get some SEO on this site come on! How can I just pick one? I won't and 
            neither should you. Pineapple works well with most, if not all meat. A good cut of beef or breast of of chicken are only enhanced
            by some pineapple. Scientifically it makes sense. The acidity of pineapple helps to tenderize the meat making it softer and more 
            delicate as you enjoy it, in addition to the flavor it brings.
        </p>
        <p>None, however top the matrimony of flavor that is pork and pineapple. Pork is often a salty meat and this saltiness can be overwehelming 
            at times. The sour sweetness of pineapple is here to balance it though, are you noticing a pattern? If you've never partaken in a holiday 
            ham enhanced by the fruit of pineapple you have not yet experienced the true joy of the seasons.

    <h3>The Truth</h3>
    <img src="./Resources/100_1593.JPG">
    <div class="bodytxt">
    <p>There is a great dead god that lives under our earth. Our civilizations and constructs are mere bacterium on the flesh of the titan. 
        It exists with no knowledge of us or the importance we place upon ourselves. Toil struggle and destroy while we can but in the end 
        it will all be in vain. The slumbering behemoth will wake and we will be cast off without so much as a breath to beg for salvation.
        There is nothing else coming to save us. There will be no retribution. Not because we were sinful, not because we did something in error. 
        But simply because we were nothing to something greater than our comprehension.
